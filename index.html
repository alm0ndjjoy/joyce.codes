      <p class="text-break lh-base">
        My name is Joyce Huang. I have a background in the hair industry,
        customer service, and sales where I've worked in a fast-paced
        environment and developed skills such as effective verbal and written
        communication, de-escalation, tech support and problem solving. While
        working at a telecommunications company the past 5 years, while I loved
        connecting new technologies and products to my customers, I wanted more
        than that, I wanted to be apart of technology that transforms the world
        we live in with endless possibilities for innovation. That's when I did
        a lot of researching and started my web development journey. I started
        to self-learn/ community-taught HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on YouTube,
        joined developer discord channels, and created a Twitter to document my
        web development journey. I then took it a step forward in my research
        into joining a bootcamp. I recently graduated from Generation, a
        non-profit organization which sets a pathway to a career in tech helping
        reskill and upskill candidates. Generation has not only taught me the
        technical skills but also the soft skills to succeed. Outside of this
        program I am learning React.JS and in the future I want to become a full
        stack developer. I know that I will be a life long learner and I'm
        excited for the challenges ahead!
